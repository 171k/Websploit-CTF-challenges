Welcome to a tiny web app where two users roam:  
Aqil, your average harmless user.  
Iman, the mysterious admin hiding juicy secrets.

You can log in as Aqil just fine...  
But Iman’s account? Off-limits.  
Unless, of course, you find a *creative* way to convince the app you're someone you're not. 🤫

⚠️ The admin panel says it’s off-limits.  
🔐 The profile page redacts secrets.  
🧠 But maybe, just maybe... you can split the session and rewrite the rules.
